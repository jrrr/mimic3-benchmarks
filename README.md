This branch contains the modifications I made to the mimic3-benchmarks repository for my master's thesis on Using Pre-Learned Semantic Representations for Analyzing Electronic Medical Records. The specific changes can be seen in the git history.

The main code repository for the thesis can be found at https://github.com/jrrr/emr-semantic-representations.
